# teams grades app

Until the current moment (January/2021), Microsoft Teams standard Assignments tool only displays students returned assignments ordered alphabetically by their second name, which is confusing for teachers in school where students are usually addressed by their first names. This app was built (with [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)) to read .csv files exported from assignments and order them alphabetically by the students first name. Additionally, it also merges multiple files into one choosing the highest grades in cases of conflict.
